Here's a detailed explanation of the blog application project that utilizes only HTML, CSS, and PHP.

Project Overview:
The blog application is designed to allow users to create, view, and comment on blog posts. It consists of several components:
1. Database: The application uses a MySQL database to store the blog posts and comments.
2.Front-end: The front-end is built with HTML and CSS. It provides the user interface for creating new blog posts, displaying existing posts, and adding comments.
3.Back-end: The back-end is implemented using PHP. It handles database interactions, such as fetching and inserting data, and dynamically generates the HTML content to be displayed in the front-end.

Now let's dive into the different parts of the project in more detail:
Database:-
The project requires a MySQL database to store blog posts and comments. Two tables are created: 'posts' and 'comments'.
Posts Table: This table stores the blog posts. It includes columns for 'id' (auto-incrementing primary key), 'title' (the title of the post), 'content' (the content of the post), and 'created_at' (timestamp of post creation).
Comments Table: This table stores the comments for each post. It includes columns for 'id' (auto-incrementing primary key), 'post_id' (foreign key referencing the 'id' column of the 'posts' table), 'author' (the name of the comment author), 'content' (the content of the comment), and 'created_at' (timestamp of comment creation).

Front-end (HTML and CSS):-
The front-end of the blog application is responsible for displaying the user interface to interact with the blog posts and comments. Here's an overview of the HTML structure:
Index Page (index.php): This page is the main entry point of the application. It displays the existing blog posts along with their comments and provides forms to add new posts and comments.
Post Display: Each blog post is displayed as a separate block. It includes the post title, content, and a section to view and add comments.
Comment Display: For each post, existing comments are listed, including the comment content and author name.
Forms: The application includes forms for creating new blog posts and adding comments. These forms send data to the back-end for processing.
Styling (CSS): The CSS file (styles.css) contains styling rules to enhance the appearance of the application. It defines fonts, colors, margins, and other visual elements to create an appealing user interface.

Back-end (PHP):-
The back-end of the blog application handles the database interactions and generates dynamic HTML content based on the stored data. Here's an overview of the PHP files:
Config File (config.php): This file contains the configuration details for connecting to the MySQL database. It establishes the database connection using the provided credentials.
Functions File (functions.php): This file includes PHP functions that interact with the database. It provides functions to fetch all blog posts and comments from the database.
Add Post (add_post.php): This PHP file handles the form submission for adding new blog posts. It retrieves the post title and content from the submitted form data and inserts them into the 'posts' table in the database.
Add Comment (add_comment.php): This PHP file handles the form submission for adding comments. It retrieves the post ID, comment author, and comment content from the submitted form data and inserts them into the 'comments' table in the database.
The PHP files include error handling to capture any issues during database operations and display appropriate error messages.

Project Workflow:-
The user visits the blog application by accessing the index.php file.
The index.php file fetches the existing blog posts and their corresponding comments from the database using the getPosts() and getComments() functions defined in functions.php.
The fetched data is dynamically rendered using HTML and displayed on the index.php page.
The user can create a new blog post by filling out the "Create a New Post" form. The submitted form data is sent to add_post.php for processing.
The add_post.php file receives the form data, validates it, and inserts the new post into the 'posts' table in the database.
The user can add comments to a specific post by filling out the comment form within the post section. The submitted form data is sent to add_comment.php for processing.
The add_comment.php file receives the form data, validates it, and inserts the new comment into the 'comments' table in the database.
After adding a new post or comment, the user is redirected back to the index.php page, and the newly added content is displayed.
Overall, this blog application demonstrates the basic functionality of creating, viewing, and commenting on blog posts using HTML, CSS, and PHP. You can further enhance the project by adding features like user authentication, editing and deleting posts/comments, or implementing a more advanced database architecture.
